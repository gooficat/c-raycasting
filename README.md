very simple raycasting with a tile based map
written in C with certain SDL modules
It has clipping issues because player is a simple point collider.

You're free to copy my code. I would love some sort of credit but it's really not necessary.

I used SDL, but only the modules video, input and time
I have seen many people, jdh included, that have done this including the whole of SDL.
However with SDL2 it is best to only include modules you need.
